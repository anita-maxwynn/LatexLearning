## Day 1 - LaTeX Practice

This folder contains my first day of practice with LaTeX.  
I explored the basics of document structure, text formatting, and simple mathematical expressions.

### Contents
- Basic document setup with `\documentclass` and `\begin{document}`
- Using special commands like `\LaTeX`
- Line breaks and comments
- Inline and display math mode examples
- Superscripts and subscripts usage

### Files
- `first1.tex` — A basic introduction to LaTeX syntax
- `second1.tex` — Practice with math expressions
- `third3.tex` — More complex math notations and formatting

### How to compile
Run the following command to generate a PDF from a `.tex` file:

```bash
pdflatex filename.tex
